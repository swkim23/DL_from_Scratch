\subsection{목적}
본 문서는 ccOS의 Lifecycle을 설명한다. Lifecycle은 개체가 생성(creation)하고 소멸(termination)하는 동안의 상태 변화를 정형화된 형태로 기술한다.
개체의 상태 변화는 

ccOS는 Linux를 기본으로 하고 있기 때문에, Linux의 lifecycle을 리뷰한다.

\section{Linux Process Lifecycle}

들어가기 앞서, Linux Process Lifecycle은 Linux Tutorial의 내용에서 참고하였다.

 From the time a process is created with a fork() until it has completed its job and disappears from the process table, it goes through many different states. The state a process is in changes many times during its ``life.'' These changes can occur, for example, when the process makes a system call, it is someone else's turn to run, an interrupt occurs, or the process asks for a resource that is currently not available.

A commonly used model shows processes operating in one of six separate states, which you can find in sched.h:

    executing in user mode
    executing in kernel mode
    ready to run
    sleeping
    newly created, not ready to run, and not sleeping
    issued exit system call (zombie)

The states listed here describe what is happening conceptually and do not indicate what "official" state a process is in. The official states are listed below:

TASK\_RUNNING	task (process) currently running
TASK\_INTERRUPTABLE	process is sleeping but can be woken up (interrupted)
TASK\_UNINTERRUPTABLE  	process is sleeping but can not be woken up (interrupted)
TASK\_ZOMBIE	process terminated but its status was not collected (it was not waited for)
TASK\_STOPPED	process stopped by a debugger or job control
TASK\_SWAPPING	(removed in 2.3.x kernel)

Table - Process States in sched.h

In my list of states, there was no mention of a process actually being on the processor (TASK\_RUNNING). Processes that are running in kernel mode or in user mode are both in the TASK\_RUNNING state. Although there is no 1:1 match-up, I hope you'll see what each state means as we go through the following description. You can see how this all looks graphically in the figure below.
